					I completed a lot of material on Treehouse. I covered JavaScript Loops, Arrays, and Objects, learned some jQuery, and built an interactive web page with Javascript. The interactive page with JS was a To Do web app. Learning how to manipulate the DOM was something that was very confusing at first but after going through that course it all started to click and I am starting to make connections with all the material. I attended a great Meetup where a front end developer from New Zealand talked about her web dev career journey. It really inspired me to continue to push forward and push even harder. I'm starting to reach out to different firms to see if they would be willing to take on an intern so that I can learn how to work on a team and contribute.

					Completed the Javascript Basics course on Treehouse! I am really getting the hang of programming and learning different programming concepts. Things like functions, conditional statements, and booleans. I a excited to continue to update my website with the concepts and features I am learning. I hope to soon add a social aspect to my site with comments and additional interactivity.

				<p>Just finished CSS Basics! I feel like the things I am learning are really starting to stick more than the last time I tried learning HTML and CSS last year. I am now moving on to Javascript, a topic I am stoked to get started on. HTML and CSS are great for creating static web pages, but Javascript will make my webpages more dynamic. It is one of the most popular languages in web development. I will keep you posted on my progress. You may even see my website start to morph and improve with the new technologies I am learning.

				<p>I wanted to use this post to talk about the dev tools I am using as a starting web developer. From an education standpoint, I am mainly focusing on <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com" target="_blank">TeamTreehouse</a>, but I know there are other sites as well like <a href="http://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank">CodeAcademy</a>and <a href="https://www.codeschool.com" target="_blank">Code School</a> where you can learn how to code. I really like the way TeamTreehouse sets up their learning tracks. 
				</p> 
				<p>From a tools standpoint, the only other thing I am using is a text editor called <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com" target="_blank">Sublime Text 2</a>. I don't use much else right now. I wanted to try to keep it simple as I learn to code then add on additional tools as I get more comfortable.

				<p>Welcome to journal chronicling my web development journey where I track my progress on becoming a front-end web developer. I am a full time Financial Advisor and I want to develop skills in web development because I am fascinated in the industry and have always had an interest. It wasn't until I came across TeamTreehouse that I decided to take the plunge and pursue this. My goal is to become a part time developer on the side once I build my skills. The prospects for the industry excite me. The fact that there is a need for developers and that need will continue to grow makes me even more excited.</p>
				<p>Completed the 1st section of the Front-End Web Development track on TeamTreehouse - How to Make a Website. I love how TeamTreehouse sets up the tracks and how they incorporate videos, quizzes, and coding challenges to strenghten learning and retention.</p>
				<p>I am currently on the section on CSS Basics. I am very excited to continue expanding my knowledge base and developing skills that I can use in the real world. I look forward to sharing my journey with all of you. </p>
